        <p>Kuakata, known as the "Daughter of the Sea," is one of the few places in the world where you can watch both sunrise and sunset over the ocean from the same beach. Located in the southern part of Bangladesh, it offers peaceful coastal views, fresh coconut water, and long walks along the sandy shoreline. Visiting the Buddhist temples nearby and mingling with the Rakhine community adds a cultural touch to the trip. Whether you want to relax or explore, Kuakata promises a calm and memorable experience.</p>
