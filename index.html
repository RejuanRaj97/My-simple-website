        <h3>My first website</h3>
        <p>Kuakata, known as the "Daughter of the Sea," is one of the few places in the world where you can watch both sunrise and sunset over the ocean from the same beach. Located in the southern part of Bangladesh, it offers peaceful coastal views, fresh coconut water, and long walks along the sandy shoreline. Visiting the Buddhist temples nearby and mingling with the Rakhine community adds a cultural touch to the trip. Whether you want to relax or explore, Kuakata promises a calm and memorable experience.</p>

        <h3>My Second website</h3>
        <p>Bandarban is a dream destination for nature lovers and thrill-seekers. Surrounded by the lush green hills of the Chittagong Hill Tracts, it offers stunning landscapes, tribal culture, and adventurous trekking routes. From climbing Nilgiri and Nilachal to exploring waterfalls like Nafakhum or Amiakhum, every moment in Bandarban feels like a story. The cool air, starry nights, and peaceful silence of the hills make it a perfect break from city chaos.</p>
